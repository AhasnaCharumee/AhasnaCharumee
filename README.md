## About Me
Iâ€™m Ahasna Charumee, a passionate software engineering student at the Institute of Software Engineering, based in Welipitiya, Sri Lanka. I specialize in crafting innovative solutions using Java, JavaFX, MySQL, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a keen interest in UI/UX design (using Figma) and full-stack development, I enjoy building projects ranging from academic systems to interactive web apps, such as the Driving School Management System and my personal portfolio. When Iâ€™m not coding, I explore photography and writing. Letâ€™s connect to collaborate or learn together!
